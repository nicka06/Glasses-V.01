--Unforunately, I did not read through the requirements and only sumbitted a hackpad thus far which led me to believe there was no journal portion. Thus, when I'm nearing the end of the project, I finally decide to make the journal. 
Although this is a bit disappointing, I'll do my best to recall what I have done thus far and lay it out in chronolocial order. Then, I'll add my future journals here as well. 

Beginning:
I started off this project by consulting with chatgpt on a parts list. It started off with a fairly comprehensive list of things that I'll need. Then, I went into snapeda the online website to browse all the parts. This was about a days worth
of work. I know it seems like not that much but this is my "first" hardware project (besides the hackpad that I did which was basically laid out for me in a step by step guide). Also as a side note, beginner projects are so important because I 
don't feel like I could have done any of this without that beginner project.

The next thing I started to do was lay out the schematic. Again, a lot of time was spent consulting with google, the datasheets, and google. It took a lot of finesse and mind numbing work but I was eventually able to get it.
I would estimate just this process took quite a while. It's worth mentioning that I spent a decent chunk of time assembling and modifying the symbols. They were very finicky. The footprint's were also a pain to do.

Middle:
Once I completed the schematic, I began working on the actual pcb design which was a HUGE pain. I learned that making small pcbs is not a fun process at all. Additioanlly, it was my first time doing it all by myself so add that to the 
mix and I was in for a disaster. I had to restart 3-4 times and it probably took 3-4 days in total to actually get it done. 

Finish Line:
Finally, I began working on the cad part of the project. In my opinion, this was the part of the project that I had the most fun with. The first thing that I did was download some images of photos, looked up the
size of a typical glasses frame, and then I started to sketch out the outline of the glasses frame. I continued to do this until I was able to complete the glasses frame (with the inside of the glasses hollowed
out for the wires to run through the frames). Once I finished that, I began working on the sides of the frames. The sides were finicky as well as I had to first model around the pcb/battery and then actually create 
the strucuture of glasses. It's worth acknowledging that in this iteration, I made the glasses fit around teh hardware if that makes sense. (So the glasses shape/fit will almost certainly not be ideal. It's my goal 
that when I begin working on this project next time, I do the opposite. I start with a really nice frame and shape for glasses and then work on the hardware to make it fit within the nice frame and size. Now, what I have
left to do as I'm writing this is to upload all of the information to the github, spend some time to slice some of the hardware so that I can assemble it once I get the components and then begin working on the firmware tommorow. 
I have a feeling that the firmware won't be that bad (famous last words). In any case, I'll give that a shot and upload all of that information tomorrow. (Also for the images, I'll post those all at the end).

Today, I continued to look through the work that I've done this far to confirm what I wanted to do with the firmware exactly. I came up with teh exact processes that I wanted to use and now that I have that, I started to work on the firmware. Tomorrow, I'll finish the rest of the firmware and submit the project.
