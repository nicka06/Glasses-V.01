# Glasses-V.01

This repo shows a pair of "AI" glasses that use a microphone, speaker, and microcontroller to allow users to have siri at all times (when on wifi). They'll be able to ask questions, complete tasks, and be more efficient with these glasses. While these glasses have only audio, it is a first step towareds glasses with cameras and more. This is my personal end goal for this project. Just a stepping stone towards more advance glasses work. (Hence the V0.1 repo name). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
